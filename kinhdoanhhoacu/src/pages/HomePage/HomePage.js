      noi dungThis week the UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority
      okayed a proposal to modify human embryos through gene editing. The
      research, which will be carried out at the Francis Crick Institute in
      London, should improve our understanding of human development. It will
      also undoubtedly attract controversy - particularly with claims that
      manipulating embryonic genomes is a first step towards designer babies.
      Those concerns shouldn't be ignored. After all, gene editing of the kind
      that will soon be undertaken at the Francis Crick Institute doesn't occur
      naturally in humans or other animals. It is, however, a lot more common in
      nature than you might think, and it's been going on for a surprisingly
      long time - revelations that have challenged what biologists thought they
      knew about the way evolution works. We're talking here about one
      particular gene editing technique called CRISPR-Cas, or just CRISPR. It's
      relatively fast, cheap and easy to edit genes with CRISPR - factors that
      explain why the technique has exploded in popularity in the last few
      years. But CRISPR wasn't dreamed up from scratch in a laboratory. This
      gene editing tool actually evolved in single-celled microbes. CRISPR went
      unnoticed by biologists for decades. It was only at the tail end of the
      1980s that researchers studying Escherichia coli noticed that there were
      some odd repetitive sequences at the end of one of the bacterial genes.
      Later, these sequences would be named Clustered Regularly Interspaced
      Short Palindromic Repeats - CRISPRs. For several years the significance of
      these CRISPRs was a mystery, even when researchers noticed that they were
      always separated from one another by equally odd 'spacer' gene sequences.
      Then, a little over a decade ago, scientists made an important discovery.
      Those 'spacer' sequences look odd because they aren't bacterial in origin.
      Many are actually snippets of DNA from viruses that are known to attack
      bacteria. In 2005, three research groups independently reached the same
      conclusion: CRISPR and its associated genetic sequences were acting as a
      bacterial immune system. In simple terms, this is how it works. A
      bacterial cell generates special proteins from genes associated with the
      CRISPR repeats (these are called CRISPR associated - Cas - proteins). If a
      virus invades the cell, these Cas proteins bind to the viral DNA and help
      cut out a chunk. Then, that chunk of viral DNA gets carried back to the
      bacterial cell's genome where it is inserted - becoming a spacer. From now
      on, the bacterial cell can use the spacer to recognise that particular
      virus and attack it more effectively. These findings were a revelation.
      Geneticists quickly realised that the CRISPR system effectively involves
      microbes deliberately editing their own genomes - suggesting the system
      could form the basis of a brand new type of genetic engineering
      technology. They worked out the mechanics of the CRISPR system and got it
      working in their lab experiments. It was a breakthrough that paved the way
      for this week's announcement by the HFEA. Exactly who took the key steps
      to turn CRISPR into a useful genetic tool is, however, the subject of a
      huge controversy. Perhaps that's inevitable - credit for developing CRISPR
      gene editing will probably guarantee both scientific fame and financial
      wealth. Beyond these very important practical applications, though,
      there's another CRISPR story. It's the account of how the discovery of
      CRISPR has influenced evolutionary biology. Sometimes overlooked is the
      fact that it wasn't just geneticists who were excited by CRISPR's
      discovery - so too were biologists. They realised CRISPR was evidence of a
      completely unexpected parallel between the way humans and bacteria fight
      infections. We've known for a long time that part of our immune system
      "learns" about the pathogens it has seen before so it can adapt and fight
      infections better in future. Vertebrate animals were thought to be the
      only organisms with such a sophisticated adaptive immune system. In light
      of the discovery of CRISPR, it seemed some bacteria had their own version.
      In fact, it turned out that lots of bacteria have their own version. At
      the last count, the CRISPR adaptive immune system was estimated to be
      present in about 40% of bacteria. Among the other major group of
      single-celled microbes - the archaea - CRISPR is even more common. It's
      seen in about 90% of them. If it's that common today, CRISPR must have a
      history stretching back over millions - possibly even billions - of years.
      "It's clearly been around for a while," says Darren Griffin at the
      University of Kent. The animal adaptive immune system, then, isn't nearly
      as unique as we thought. And there's one feature of CRISPR that makes it
      arguably even better than our adaptive immune system: CRISPR is heritable.
      When we are infected by a pathogen, our adaptive immune system learns from
      the experience, making our next encounter with that pathogen less of an
      ordeal. This is why vaccination is so effective: it involves priming us
      with a weakened version of a pathogen to train our adaptive immune system.
      Your children, though, won't benefit from the wealth of experience locked
      away in your adaptive immune system. They have to experience an infection
      - or be vaccinated - first hand before they can learn to deal with a given
      pathogen. CRISPR is different. When a microbe with CRISPR is attacked by a
      virus, the record of the encounter is hardwired into the microbe's DNA as
      a new spacer. This is then automatically passed on when the cell divides
      into daughter cells, which means those daughter cells know how to fight
      the virus even before they've seen it. We don't know for sure why the
      CRISPR adaptive immune system works in a way that seems, at least
      superficially, superior to ours. But perhaps our biological complexity is
      the problem, says Griffin. "In complex organisms any minor [genetic]
      changes cause profound effects on the organism," he says. Microbes might
      be sturdy enough to constantly edit their genomes during their lives and
      cope with the consequences - but animals probably aren't. The discovery of
      this heritable immune system was, however, a biologically astonishing one.
      It means that some microbes write their lifetime experiences of their
      environment into their genome and then pass the information to their
      offspring – and that is something that evolutionary biologists did not
      think happened. Darwin's theory of evolution is based on the idea that
      natural selection acts on the naturally occurring random variation in a
      population. Some organisms are better adapted to the environment than
      others, and more likely to survive and reproduce, but this is largely
      because they just happened to be born that way. But before Darwin, other
      scientists had suggested different mechanisms through which evolution
      might work. One of the most famous ideas was proposed by a French
      scientist called Jean-Bapteste Lamarck. He thought organisms actually
      changed during their life, acquiring useful new adaptations non-randomly
      in response to their environmental experiences. They then passed on these
      changes to their offspring. People often use giraffes to illustrate
      Lamarck's hypothesis. The idea is that even deep in prehistory, the
      giraffe's ancestor had a penchant for leaves at the top of trees. This
      early giraffe had a relatively short neck, but during its life it spent so
      much time stretching to reach leaves that its neck lengthened slightly.
      The crucial point, said Lamarck, was that this slightly longer neck was
      somehow inherited by the giraffe's offspring. These giraffes also
      stretched to reach high leaves during their lives, meaning their necks
      lengthened just a little bit more, and so on. Once Darwin's ideas gained
      traction, Lamarck's ideas became deeply unpopular. But the CRISPR immune
      system - in which specific lifetime experiences of the environment are
      passed on to the next generation - is one of a tiny handful of natural
      phenomena that arguably obeys Lamarckian principles. "The realisation that
      Lamarckian type of evolution does occur and is common enough, was as
      startling to biologists as it seems to a layperson," says Eugene Koonin at
      the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, who explored the
      idea with his colleagues in 2009, and does so again in a paper due to be
      published later this year. This isn't to say that all of Lamarck's
      thoughts on evolution are back in vogue. "Lamarck had additional ideas
      that were important to him, such as the inherent drive to perfection that
      to him was a key feature of evolution," says Koonin. No modern
      evolutionary biologist goes along with that idea. But the discovery of the
      CRISPR system still implies that evolution isn't purely the result of
      Darwinian random natural selection. It can sometimes involve elements of
      non-random Lamarckism too – a "continuum", as Koonin puts it. In other
      words, the CRISPR story has had a profound scientific impact far beyond
      the doors of the genetic engineering lab. It truly was a transformative
      discovery.
